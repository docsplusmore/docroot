# Docs Plus More

Technology and Gadgets can be hard to understand, setup and operate. The work of adapting newly acquired technologies or products (such as an open-source codebase or tool, a new phone or appliance, an account in a new dating service, a new type of wrench etc.) to your specific  work or life situation is non-trivial. Most of us settle for labouring through our new stuff until we get it working and then stop without understanding every advanced feature. But often there is the nagging voice - did I set it up like I should have or is my setup sub-optimal? Will I have to come back to this because I didn't read that 60 page manual or readme document word-to-word when I setup things? Am I leaving value on the table by not understanding the capabilities of my new tech piece? And the worst - will I get hacked because of my trivial setup or will I void the warranty because I didn't build that DiY piece of furniture right?

Back in the day installation support was a real part of the product offering. Software that was installed and configured by professional services teams, computers that were setup and tuned by their vendors, furniture that was assembled by carpenters - you get the idea. Not any more - a great example of this is open-source software where you can download millions of lines of complex code with a "quickstart" document, un-commented code, and copious amounts of computer-generated API documents. Its up to you to figure out how to make this work for your use case. Go figure.

## But things are working...

True! Open-source software powers billions of devices and networks and business use-cases. Do-it-yourself is almost the default method to setup gadgets and websites and even bank accounts. Most of us, you know, figure it out at the end.

But does it work effortlessly? Think of the last time you struggled and googled your way with an installation. The exasperation because of terse documentation, the hours spent figuring out that simple step, or worse, the resignation of giving up when you couldn't get something to work. That bitter feeling when you delete a promising bit of open-source software because it didn't work out or printing out that return label to send back a gadget you couldn't get working. Wasted. Time.

## Many people probably know how to unblock you

There is someone out there who can unblock stuck users. Maybe its the product or customer success team who can augment their documents with inside knowledge. Or maybe its a power user who has successfully deployed the product multiple times and knows about advanced use-cases beyond the quickstart document.

Docs plus more is a call to those folks. Share your expertise to help
